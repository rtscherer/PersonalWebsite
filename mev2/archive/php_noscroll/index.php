			My name is <span class="orangetext">Ryan Scherer</span>.
			I'm a software developer with a passion for the web. Music motivates me,
			craft beer relaxes me, and playing piano fulfills my never ending need to learn 
			and challenge myself. I created this site purely for fun, and I'd be lying if
			I said I didn't enjoy a cold brew or two while doing so.
